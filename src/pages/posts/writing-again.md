# Reflecting on life

The last time I wrote a blog was 5 years ago when I was one year out of college working at FullStory. I joined as 30th-ish engineer . By the time I left, the engineering team doubled. It was my first time witnessing hyper growth at a startup. Since it was published on a company’s engineering blog, I drafted and iterated based on feedback from my colleagues. To this day, I’m still grateful for my experience at FullStory that no other employer has been able to match. It was a combination of the collective care for engineering craft, good people, [TODO].

Since then, I never had the motive to write more in a public setting. English is not my native language so writing a publishable blog mandates tons of my time. Once in a while, I have this internal nudge telling me “let’s write a blog”. But my mentality never had the muscle to do it. The moment that I sat down to begin drafting, most of the spark had gone. I couldn’t organize my old thoughts into paragraphs. Next morning, I’m already distracted by other priorities.

Near the end of 2025, I bumped into the “Writing for Developers” book on Discord. The book lists the reasons I should write a blog and calls out excuses for not writing. It even has a section “1.3.2 Not even a native English speaker” to speak directly to engineers like me.

I do believe my weaknesses are bottlenecks to my growth. And if I neglect them, they would never improve. For 2026, I aim to dig back into things that I want to improve but was too scared to: guitar, blogging, system programming, programming languages, and AI (of course!).

### Recovering

My life has been on a rollercoaster since I graduated from college in 2019. I hit my rock bottom in 2023 and found myself diagnosed with major depressive disorder in early 2024.

On paper, I had everything my younger self would admire. A part-time teaching job at a university on top of a dream job at Google. I loved my job. But due to my mental health, I couldn’t hold everything I loved anymore. To prioritize health, I took a break from corporate to travel the world. I spent 2 weeks in India. A few months later, I solo-travelled to Bhutan and Vietnam and did a 2-month mindfulness retreat in Thailand.

While traveling, I interviewed and got recruited for a startup which operate in the US and Vietnam. I had been curious of Vietnam’s tech landscape for a long time. So I took the offer as a opportunity to explore Vietnam. In the second half of 2024, almost all of my life aspects changed. I woke up with a $1 delicious coffee, talked with random people on the streets in my native language (I hadn’t had this experience since migrating to the US 15 years ago). On weekends, I found myself at places like Singapore, northern Vietnam, and mindfulness centers. One of my therapist’s advices was “to break the cycle, change your environment if you can”. She was right on that.

2025 was the continuation of my healing journey. I was able to get back to running regularly. I kept on hitting personal streaks like faster 5km ever or longest run (6.5km!) ever.

### Learning the fundamentals

For the past 2 years, I slowed down my career progression to prioritize my mental health recovery. I learned to look at life from different lens and rebuilt it from scratch. I’m now confident enough to claim that I’m ready to hop on the technology train again.

2026 and onward, I will step back and learn things at the fundamental level. For example, I started learning music theory instead of just playing chords of the most loved songs. It could be bumpy but that’s the only way if I want to ever compose my own music or be part of a band. 

I learned to code in my college junior year by accident. At the time, I was doing an electrical engineering internship and my boss hoped that I knew how to code to help him automate some tasks. I took CS50 on edX. A few months later, I switched major to computer science and never looked back.

Like learning to code by accident, I also grew interests in developer tools by accident. At FullStory, I, along with another senior engineer, was assigned to found a frontend framework team from scratch. We built tools to accelerate React adoption across the whole company. As the React adoption gained traction, I joined the build team to ensure CI time didn’t churn as the Typescript codebase grew too quickly. That experience got me a position to work on Bazel at Google.
