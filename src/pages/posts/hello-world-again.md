# Hello world, again

The last time I wrote a blog post was five years ago. I was a year out of college, working at FullStory as the 30th-ish engineer. By the time I left, the team had doubled. It was my first taste of startup hypergrowth. I remember itereating on that post countless of time based on my colleagues'feedback.

English isn't my native language. Writing a "publishable" blog post always mandates tons of time. But every so often I'd get that nudge: "let's write something." I'd sit down, ready to draft, and the spark would be gone. My thoughts wouldn't organize into paragraphs. By the next morning, other priorities had already taken over. Other times, I just waited to have a perfect blogging system.

It's January of 2026. January is a liminal space to chart closer to who I want to become. Looking back, I always wanted to become a better writer. After many new years have passed and recovering from depression, I finally feel ready to be curious again.

This will be a space where I share in public about the things I'm curious about: guitar and music theory, developer tools, programming languages, AI (of course!), and even writing itself! I'm far from expert in all of these and that's exactly why I'm curious about them.

## Recovering from depression

My life took a downturn in 2023. I hit my rock bottom and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in early 2024. I was hopeless and was stuck in the cycle of losing sleep, not having a good day at work for many months, and regretting about an unproductive day while trying to sleep.

On paper, I had everything my younger self would have admired: a part-time teaching gig at a university, a dream job at Google. I loved my work. But I couldn't hold onto everything I loved anymore. I eventually took a break from corporate to save my mental health. I traveled two weeks in India, then Bhutan and Vietnam, then had a two-month mindfulness retreat in Thailand. One of my therapists told me: "To break the cycle, change your environment if you can." She was right. Traveling did something good to my mind.

In between my travels, I found a role at a startup that let me split time between the US and Vietnam. In the second half of 2024, all aspects of my life started to change. In the morning, I biked to coffee shop for a $1 cup of coffee, spoke my native language (Vietnamese) on the streets (something I hadn't done regularly in 14 years), and spent weekends in Singapore and northern Vietnam and at mindfulness centers.

2025 was the continuation of my healing journey. I started to exercise more regularly. In 2025, I ran across the biome project as I was looking to speed up the CI time for a project I was part of. I contributed a few PRs to biome just for fun and slowly immersed myself with the community on Discord. There, I found Bluesky and Mastodon which gave me a fresh look into how better social media can be. The online communities felt like home.

## Honing my focus

I learned to code by accident. In my junior year, my electrical engineering boss needed help automating some tasks, so I took CS50 taught at Harvard on edX as quick as possible to get the job done. A few months later, I switched my major and never looked back.

I stumbled into developer tools the same way. At FullStory, I and another senior engineer were assigned to found an app framework team from scratch to accelerate React adoption. As the React adoption gained enough traction, I moved to the build team to make sure CI time wouldn't churn as the Typescript codebase grew. That experience got me a position to work on Bazel again at Google.

My career path keeps switching so much that I don't claim myself an expert in anything. But as I progressed in my career (in addition to recovered from mental issues), my interests became more clear.

2025 was an interesting year in tech. There has been so much advancement in AI that I felt a bit lost to keep up because my job doesn't sit in that intersection.

Despite that, I aim to spend my 2026 and many years ahead to study things that are fundamental and won't go out fashion quickly. Things that will help me learn new things faster throughout the upcoming years.

So here I am. Hello world, again!
